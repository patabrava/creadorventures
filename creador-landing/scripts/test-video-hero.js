console.log('============================');
console.log('\nFollow these steps to test the VideoHero component:');

console.log('\n1. Initial State Tests:');
console.log('   ✓ Navigate to the homepage and verify VideoHero appears between Hero and VerticalSections');
console.log('   ✓ Confirm "Play reel" text is visible with circular play button');
console.log('   ✓ Check that the poster image is displayed if specified');
console.log('   ✓ Verify that hovering over the play button increases its border width');
console.log('   ✓ Ensure the component is responsive on different screen sizes');

console.log('\n2. Playback Tests:');
console.log('   ✓ Click the play button and verify the video starts playing');
console.log('   ✓ Confirm the overlay (with "Play reel" text) fades out when playing');
console.log('   ✓ Let the video play to completion and verify it returns to the initial state');
console.log('   ✓ Test keyboard navigation (Tab to focus play button, Enter to play)');

console.log('\n3. Error Handling Tests:');
console.log('   ✓ Temporarily modify videoSrc to an invalid URL and verify error handling');
console.log('   ✓ Click "Try Again" button and confirm it attempts to reload the video');
console.log('   ✓ Test with network throttling to simulate slow connections');
console.log('   ✓ Verify fallback poster image displays properly when video fails to load');

console.log('\n4. Browser Compatibility Tests:');
console.log('   ✓ Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge');
console.log('   ✓ Verify mobile compatibility on iOS and Android devices');
console.log('   ✓ Check that video format fallbacks work in different browsers');

console.log('\n5. Accessibility Tests:');
console.log('   ✓ Verify all interactive elements are keyboard accessible');
console.log('   ✓ Use a screen reader to confirm proper ARIA attributes');
console.log('   ✓ Check color contrast for text elements');
console.log('   ✓ Ensure the component respects user\'s reduced motion preferences');

console.log('\n6. Performance Tests:');
console.log('   ✓ Verify video is lazy-loaded and doesn\'t affect initial page load');
console.log('   ✓ Check network tab to confirm video loads only when played');
console.log('   ✓ Measure time from click to playback start');
console.log('   ✓ Test memory usage during and after video playback');
