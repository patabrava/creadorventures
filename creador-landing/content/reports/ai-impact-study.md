This report explores how artificial intelligence technologies are being deployed to solve unique challenges in emerging economies. Rather than simply importing AI models and approaches from developed markets, we examine how local innovators are developing context-specific applications that address critical needs in healthcare, agriculture, education, and financial inclusion.

## Research Highlights

- Survey of 150+ AI startups across 12 countries in LATAM, Africa, and Eastern Europe
- Analysis of adaptations required for AI deployment in low-resource environments
- Examination of policy frameworks that balance innovation with appropriate safeguards
- Recommendations for investors, founders, and policymakers to foster responsible AI ecosystems

Our findings suggest that the most successful AI implementations in these markets combine global technical advances with deep local knowledge, creating solutions that are both innovative and contextually appropriate.
